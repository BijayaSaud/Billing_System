# Billing_System
Billing System in Super_Market Using C++.

## Supermarket Billing System (C++ Project)

This is a simple console-based Supermarket Billing System developed in C++. The project allows users to manage products and generate invoices for customers. It features two main user roles: **Admin** and **Customer**.

### Features

- **Admin Panel:**
  - Add new products with code, name, price, and discount.
  - Search, edit, and delete products.
  - View all available products.

- **Customer Panel:**
  - Browse product list.
  - Place orders for multiple products.
  - Generate and print invoices with discounts applied.

### How It Works

- Product data is stored in a text file (`product.txt`).
- Admin access is protected by a simple email and password check.
- The system uses basic file handling for data persistence.
- All operations are performed via a text-based menu interface.

### Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Choose between Admin and Customer modes from the main menu.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to manage products
